An esports-based clicker game about a player who wants to join Team Liquid! This game was made for Liquid Hacks 2.0.

Our game, Esports Champion, is made in Unity with C#. It is a clicker game about an aspiring gamer who wants to join Team Liquid. 
To do this, he must become a skilled player, be an influencer, and win tournaments. These are the 3 aspects we focused on when developing the game. 
Skill points are earned by playing aim trainer games. The more targets you hit and the more accurate you are, the more points you gain. 
Influence points are earned by streaming on Twitch, which gives passive influence points, which you can speed up by clicking a button rapidly, 
uploading on YouTube, which gives you a bonus percentage of the influence points you have already, and tweeting on Twitter, which gives you a fixed amount of influence points. 
Twitch and YouTube also give you money, which you can use to participate in tournaments. Your win rate in tournaments is decided by how many skill points you have. 
This is the core gameplay loop which you repeat until you hit a certain threshold in influence points, skill points, and tournament wins, after which your dreams are finally 
fulfilled and you join Team Liquid.
